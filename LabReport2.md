The method that is being called here is the `handleRequest()` method because of my line where I wrote `Server.start(port, new Handler());`
The method takes the URL and divides up the paths to do certain commands, and for ChatServer if it has the path "/add-message" then you can 
add the string and user's name that you want to add to the website.
The values for this image and the "user" query were "jpolitz" and the "message" query was "I'm Chilling, What about youself, big dawg?"

This image calls the same method with a different URL, the change in the URL is the "user" query and the "message" query. For this image the user was mpaoletta
and the message was "I been good, but man are these Lab Reports challenging?"

Here is an image of me logging into ieng6, but I am confused because I still have to input my password. 

## Part 3:
I learned how to properly sign into a ssh and the ways to access certain directories within that ssh. This process should be very useful for my future in coding
as it is very common to access websites and have code to break down paths. I am very glad that I was able to learn these very useful skills.
