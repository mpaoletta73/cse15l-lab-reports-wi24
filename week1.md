## 1. `cd` Example With No Arguments

At this point, the working directory was /home <br>
This command requires the name of a file or folder so that it can change the current directory. <br> The terminal thinks that the file that you are trying to find is just the basic /home so it keeps the directory the same. <br>
This output is not an error since you are just trying to change the directory back to the original directory. <br>
